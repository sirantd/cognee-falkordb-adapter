"""The other half of A5: the pin, and the census that makes the pin mean something.

``test_contract.py`` proves the adapter satisfies cognee's provenance contract.
That proof is worth exactly as much as the cognee it ran against is fixed:
the graph interface has moved twice in four months, and an unpinned suite tests
whatever pip resolved that morning while still reporting 19 green.

So three things are asserted here, all server-free:

* the test extra pins cognee **exactly** (``==``, not a range),
* the installed cognee **is** that pin,
* the suite still holds the **same 19 cases**, by name, and the gate module
  really did shadow the fixture rather than inherit the suite's own providers.

📌 The census is the part that catches a *deliberate* upgrade. Bumping the pin
makes these tests fail before anything else does, which forces the suite to be
re-read rather than re-run — a renamed or deleted case would otherwise shrink
coverage silently, and a new one would arrive unnoticed.
