"""The A1 gate: the adapter covers its target surface, with signatures that match.

Deliberately needs NO FalkorDB server. Whether every abstract method is present
is a property of the class object (``__abstractmethods__``), and signature drift
is a property of two ``inspect.Signature`` objects — turning either into an
integration test would mean the cheapest, highest-value check only runs when
infrastructure happens to be up.

The signature check is the one that earns its keep. cognee calls most of these
from inside a pipeline, so a drifted parameter surfaces as a TypeError three
layers from the cause, during a drain, at 03:00.
